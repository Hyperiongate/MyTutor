# main.py  --  Math Tutor MVP  --  Hyperion Shift LLC
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CHANGE NOTES (keep newest at top):
#   2026-07-21  DURABLE STORAGE FOUNDATION (opt-in). Added store.py (SQLAlchemy) and
#               routed session + placement persistence through it: when DATABASE_URL
#               is set (e.g. a Render PostgreSQL instance) memory lives in the DB and
#               survives deploys/sleeps; when it's NOT set the app uses the SAME JSON
#               files as before, so nothing changes for the current deploy. /health
#               now reports storage status. This is the base for real per-topic
#               tracking, accounts, and subscriptions.
#   2026-07-21  HOME HUB + TOPIC MODE. Added GET /home (the "what would you like to
#               do today?" hub: course / practice / topic), GET /topic (topic page),
#               and POST /api/topic (mini-lesson on a chosen topic via
#               tutor.get_topic_reply; client-held history, not persisted). Login and
#               the Challenge now land placed students on /home instead of /session.
#   2026-07-21  PRACTICE MODE. Added GET /practice (serves practice.html) and
#               POST /api/practice: the student brings a specific problem from school
#               and Mr. Cadabra coaches them through it (tutor.get_practice_reply).
#               Practice history is CLIENT-held and passed in each request (sanitized
#               here), so nothing is persisted -- a homework problem is a one-off.
#   2026-07-21  ENTRY-FLOW + DURABLE-MEMORY GROUNDWORK.
#               • /api/login now also returns `placed` (has the student done the
#                 placement Challenge?) so the login screen can force first-timers
#                 to "find their level" before any lesson.
#               • /api/session/{code} now also returns `placement` + `placed` so the
#                 lesson page can enforce the flow and pick first-tour vs welcome-back.
#               • DATA_DIR is now overridable via the DATA_DIR env var so memory can
#                 live on a Render PERSISTENT DISK (e.g. /var/data) and survive
#                 redeploys/sleeps. Default unchanged (BASE_DIR/data).
#   2026-07-20  Added POST /api/transcribe: server-side speech-to-text via
#               ElevenLabs Scribe (reuses ELEVENLABS_API_KEY). The browser records
#               the student's audio and posts it here; we return the text. This
#               replaces the flaky browser SpeechRecognition. Model via
#               ELEVENLABS_STT_MODEL (default scribe_v1).
#   2026-07-19  Added Mr. Cadabra's Challenge (placement quiz): GET /challenge,
#               POST/GET /api/placement/{code} (persisted to data/placements.json).
#               Placement now feeds BOTH the dashboard (via progress.py) and the
#               tutor (the placement is injected into the tutor's progress context
#               in /api/chat, so he starts each student at the right level).
#   2026-07-19  Firmed up ElevenLabs voice_settings (stability 0.55 + speaker
#               boost) to reduce garbled words.
#   2026-07-19  Added the progress DASHBOARD: GET /dashboard (serves
#               dashboard.html) and GET /api/progress/{code} (data from
#               progress.py -- currently representative sample data, real shape).
#   2026-07-19  LOW-LATENCY VOICE. /api/speak is now a STREAMING GET that proxies
#               ElevenLabs' stream endpoint (audio starts playing before it's fully
#               generated), and the default model is now eleven_flash_v2_5 (fast).
#               Added /api/voice-status so the frontend knows whether the natural
#               voice is available before requesting it. Removed the old POST speak.
#   2026-07-19  Set the default ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID to Jim's chosen voice
#               (sB7vwSCyX0tQmU24cW2C) so a fresh deploy uses it even without the
#               env var. Still overridable via the ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID env var.
#   2026-07-19  Added POST /api/speak: proxies ElevenLabs text-to-speech so the
#               tutor can talk in a natural voice. The API key stays server-side
#               (env ELEVENLABS_API_KEY). If the key is missing or the call fails,
#               it returns 204 and the browser falls back to its built-in voice.
#               Voice/model configurable via ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID / ELEVENLABS_MODEL.
#   2026-07-19  Initial Day 1 backbone. FastAPI backend that:
#                 - serves the minimal code-entry screen and the session screen
#                 - validates a student login code against students.json
#                 - runs a text chat with the tutor (tutor.py / Claude API)
#                 - remembers each student's conversation across logins by
#                   saving it to data/sessions.json
#               Voice (Day 3) and the animated orb options (Day 5) are not here
#               yet; this is the backbone they will plug into.
#
# HOW IT RUNS:
#   Locally:  uvicorn main:app --reload
#   Render:   uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT   (see render.yaml)
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT MEMORY ON RENDER:
#   sessions.json + placements.json (under DATA_DIR) let the tutor remember each
#   student and their placement. On Render's FREE web service the disk is EPHEMERAL
#   -- it resets on every redeploy AND whenever the service sleeps (~15 min idle) --
#   so students look brand new each time. To make memory DURABLE, attach a Render
#   PERSISTENT DISK (needs a paid Starter instance), mount it at e.g. /var/data, and
#   set env var DATA_DIR=/var/data. The code already reads DATA_DIR, so no code
#   change is needed once the disk is attached.
